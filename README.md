## Project Goal

Create a nice chat app build in html, css, javascript (front-end) and 
spring boot framework (back-end) in the scope of learning web programming.

## Setting up the project

Type in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PredescuSebastianIon/Chat-App.git
cd Chat-App
```

Now, just create a file named `.env`, copy into it the content from 
`.env.template` and complete it with database information.

Also, you can just type `cat .env.template > .env` command into your bash terminal.
